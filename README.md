# CAMERA Need Assessment Survey (NAS)
The Needs Assessment Survey (NAS) was designed to identify MRI needs unique to Africa based on a pilot field survey of seven MRI facilities in Nigeria in 2020 and the RAD-AID Radiology-Readiness Survey<sup> TM </sup>. The survey, along with a series of symposia at international MRI society meetings informed a framework for addressing MRI needs in Africa and a model for advancing imaging capacity in resource-limited settings.

The aims of the NAS are to: 
1. Identify and understand needs and challenges of conducting MRI for clinical use and research in Africa.

2. Identify and understand gaps in training of highly qualified personnel in MRI research and clinical practice.

3. Create educational programs to help close gaps in training of highly qualified personnel in MRI. 

4. Create a network of MRI experts and users from Africa interested in collaborating with African MRI scientists and global partners.

5. Help our vendor partners know how to support MRI needs in Africa.  

This 15 minute survey is the first step towards achieving CAMERA's vision of reducing the disparity in access to MRI in Africa.
