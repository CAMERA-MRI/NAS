# NAS
The Needs Assessment Survey (NAS) was designed to identify MRI needs unique to Africa based on a pilot field survey of seven MRI facilities in Nigeria in 2020 and the RAD-AIDTM Radiology-Readiness Survey.

This 15 minute survey is the first step towards achieving CAMERA's vision of reducing the disparity in MRI research capacity in Africa. If you want to complete the survey follow the links to do so in [English](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2wIW2Hdd_KCUYIBz8AxkwK509C0VwreAbr4od6w4cYx6mCA/viewform) or in French.
